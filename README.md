A small test I had to complete for an audition for a job I applied
The instructions were as followed:

Create Python code that extracts the financial data and puts it into a csv file.  Note there are MANY fields of information.  You may choose to select some variables or extract it all; just explain what you are doing and why.
With this data,
Provide a frequency of the tax year for this data
Provide descriptive statistics for at least 1-2 variables of your choosing.  Write 1-2 sentences about each
Create a readme file that describes your process, and any issues you may have had.  It is OK to have issues and would not necessarily be seen as a weaknessâ€”the key is to be able to describe the issue and how you might go about solving the issue
Provide a time log of how long each of the above took.
