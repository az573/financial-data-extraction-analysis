A small test I had to complete for an audition for a job I applied.

The instructions were as followed:

Create Python code that extracts the financial data and puts it into a csv file.  Note there are MANY fields of information.  You may choose to select some variables or extract it all; just explain what you are doing and why.

With this data,
Provide a frequency of the tax year for this data

Provide descriptive statistics for at least 1-2 variables of your choosing.Write 1-2 sentences about each.

Create a readme file that describes your process, and any issues you may have had.  It is OK to have issues and would not necessarily be seen as a weaknessâ€”the key is to be able to describe the issue and how you might go about solving the issue.

Provide a time log of how long each of the above took.


This project extracts key financial data from XML files provided by the IRS. It  focuses on extracting the tax year and revenue ts) information from each XML file, and saves the results in a CSV file for usage. Additionally, it generates summary statistics and saves them to into a text file.
I started with being able to import all of the raw XMLs into the code for it to be able to read.
After that, I worked on extracted the code, then being able to print all the data gathered in an digestable way.
Most of the statstics I chose were very simple, but I figured they would be useful despite that. Knowing the min, average, , standard deviation, and max I feel are a good places to start.

Time Log:
I will say that this is my first time doing something like this, so it took a lot of time for me to learn and apply what I learned into this code

Importing the XML and figuring out how to use it took me around 25 minutes
Using the data from the XMl and reading the data: 1 hour and 15 minutes roughly
Taking the data and show casing it in a digestable way: 30 minutes
